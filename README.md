# Logistic-Regession

##### Logistic regression is a statistical method used to analyze relationships between a binary dependent variable (also known as the outcome variable) and one or more independent variables (also known as predictor variables or covariates). It is a type of regression analysis that is commonly used when the dependent variable is categorical or binary (i.e., takes on values of 0 or 1). The goal of logistic regression is to predict the probability of the dependent variable taking on a certain value, given the values of the independent variables.

##### Logistic regression is a powerful tool in data analysis and has a wide range of applications in various fields, including finance, marketing, healthcare, and social sciences. It can be used to analyze the impact of various factors on a particular outcome, identify significant predictors of the outcome, and evaluate the performance of a model in predicting the outcome.

##### When applying logistic regression to a data set, the first step is to identify the dependent variable and the independent variables. In the data set provided, the dependent variable appears to be the "Target" column, which is an object data type. The independent variables are the other columns in the data set, including demographic information such as gender, age, and marital status, as well as academic data such as previous qualifications and curricular units.

##### Once the dependent and independent variables have been identified, the data can be split into training and testing sets, and a logistic regression model can be trained on the training set. This involves estimating the coefficients for the independent variables in the model using a maximum likelihood method. The trained model can then be used to predict the probabilities of the dependent variable taking on a certain value in the testing set.

##### There are various performance metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics provide information about how well the model is able to correctly predict the outcome variable.



##### In summary, logistic regression is a powerful statistical tool for analyzing the relationships between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It has a wide range of applications in various fields, and can be used to identify significant predictors of an outcome, evaluate the performance of a model, and make predictions based on the values of the independent variables. The application of logistic regression to a data set involves identifying the dependent and independent variables, training a model on a training set, and evaluating the performance of the model using various performance metrics
